### Q. 3 Classical Security Objectives?
**Confidentiality** (secrecy, privacy): Information is not exposed to unauthorized parties.

**Integrity**: Information is not modified by unauthorized parties.

**Availability**: Information can be accessed by authorized parties at proper time.

### Q. What are Threat, Vulnerability, incident, and Attacks?
**Threat**: Something bad that could happen.

**Vulnerability**: Weakness in an information system that could be exploited.

**Incident**: When a vulnerability is exploited to compromise the security of systems, the result is a security incident.

**Attack**: Some action taken by a malicious intruder (Passive Adversary and Active Adversary).

### Q. What are Moore‚Äôs law, Gates‚Äô law, Neumann‚Äôs law, Metcalfe‚Äôs law, Evan‚Äôs Law?
**Moore‚Äôs law**: Processing power doubles every 18 months.

**Gates‚Äô law**: Software grows to use all available memory and processing power. (Multics 1970: ~55k lines of code; Windows 2000: ~55M lines of code)

**Neumann‚Äôs law**: Number of bugs increases as square of code size. Number of vulnerabilities is approximately linear in the number of program bugs.

**Metcalfe‚Äôs law**: Value of a network is square of number of users.

**Evan‚Äôs Law**: Security risk is the product of the number of vulnerabilities and the value of network.

### Q. Why is defense so hard (Principle of Easiest Penetration)?
An intruder only needs to find **one** vulnerability while defender needs to control **all** possible vulnerabilities.

### Q. How to achieve security (control)?
**Policy** (What we are trying to protect); **Mechanism** (How to enforce the security policy); **Assurance** (How well the security mechanism enforces the policy).

### Q. What is Kerckhoffs Principle?
Only the key should be kept secret, while the algorithm itself should be publicly known.

### Q. What are Security Tradeoffs?
Cost and Mateinance, Efficiency and User Experience, Risk and Compliance.

## üìñ Encryption Basics <div id="encryption"></div>

### Q. What is Cryptography, Cryptology, Encryption, Decryption, Cryptosystem, Cryptographer, Cryptanalyst?
**Cryptography**, or **cryptology** is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication.

**Encryption** is the process of encoding information. This process converts the original representation of the information, known as plaintext, into an alternative form known as ciphertext. Only authorized parties can decipher a ciphertext back to plaintext and access the original information.

**Decryption** is generally the reverse process of encryption. It is the process of decoding the data which has been encrypted into a secret format.

**Cryptographers** secure computer and information technology systems by creating algorithms and ciphers to encrypt data. Cryptographers also analyze existing encryption systems to identify weaknesses and vulnerabilities. They develop and test cryptology theories and techniques, implementing new or revamped encryption solutions.

**Cryptosystem** is a suite of cryptographic algorithms needed to implement a particular security service, most commonly for achieving confidentiality. Typically, a cryptosystem consists of three algorithms: one for key generation, one for encryption, and one for decryption.

**Cryptanalysts** understand how to decipher secret codes and write codes that cannot be cracked by hackers. 

### Q. What is Symmetric Cryptosystem?
In an¬†encryption¬†system the sender and receiver of a message share **a single, common¬†key**¬†that is used to encrypt and decrypt the message.

### Q. Scenarios of cryptanalysis?

| Scenarios | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| Ciphertext only | Cryptanalyst knows ciphertext only |
| Known plaintext | Cryptanalyst happens to know some plaintext-ciphertext pairs |
| Chosen plaintext | Cryptanalyst knows some plaintext-ciphertext pairs for selected plaintext |
| Chosen ciphertext | Cryptanalyst knows some plaintext-ciphertext pairs for selected ciphertext |
