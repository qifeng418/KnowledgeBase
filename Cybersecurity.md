## ðŸ“– Introduction

### Q: 3 Classical Security Objectives?
**Confidentiality** (secrecy, privacy): Information is not exposed to unauthorized parties.

**Integrity**: Information is not modified by unauthorized parties.

**Availability**: Information can be accessed by authorized parties at proper time.

### Q: What are Threat, Vulnerability, incident, and Attacks?
**Threat**: Something bad that could happen.

**Vulnerability**: Weakness in an information system that could be exploited.

**Incident**: When a vulnerability is exploited to compromise the security of systems, the result is a security incident.

**Attack**: Some action taken by a malicious intruder (Passive Adversary and Active Adversary).

### Q: What are Mooreâ€™s law, Gatesâ€™ law, Neumannâ€™s law, Metcalfeâ€™s law, Evanâ€™s Law?
**Mooreâ€™s law**: Processing power doubles every 18 months.

**Gatesâ€™ law**: Software grows to use all available memory and processing power. (Multics 1970: ~55k lines of code; Windows 2000: ~55M lines of code)

**Neumannâ€™s law**: Number of bugs increases as square of code size. Number of vulnerabilities is approximately linear in the number of program bugs.

**Metcalfeâ€™s law**: Value of a network is square of number of users.

**Evanâ€™s Law**: Security risk is the product of the number of vulnerabilities and the value of network.

### Q: Why is defense so hard (Principle of Easiest Penetration)?
An intruder only needs to find **one** vulnerability while defender needs to control **all** possible vulnerabilities.

### Q: How to achieve security (control)?
**Policy** (What we are trying to protect); **Mechanism** (How to enforce the security policy); **Assurance** (How well the security mechanism enforces the policy).

### Q: What is Kerckhoffs Principle?
Only the key should be kept secret, while the algorithm itself should be publicly known.

### Q: What are Security Tradeoffs?
Cost and Mateinance, Efficiency and User Experience, Risk and Compliance.

## ðŸ“– Encryption Basics

### Q: What is Cryptography, Encryption, Decryption, Cryptosystem, Cryptographer, Cryptanalyst, Cryptology?
Cryptography â€“ hidden writing
The meaning of ciphertext is hidden from Mallory
Encryption â€“ encode or encipher
Alice changes the plaintext to ciphertext
Decryption â€“ decode or decipher
Bob recovers the plaintext from the ciphertext
Cryptosystem â€“ a system for encryption and decryption 
Cryptographer â€“ anyone who invents encryption algorithms
Cryptanalyst â€“ anyone who attempts to break encryption algorithms
Cryptology â€“ research of encryption and decryption, including both cryptography and cryptanalysis
